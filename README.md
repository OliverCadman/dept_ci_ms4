# DepT - A platform created by artists, for artists.

Dept is a full-stack, community-led, subscription-based platform allowing musicians and artists to advertise their skills and services
to band leaders, producers, other artists, or any client that requires a last-minute musician to provide a service.

If a musician booked for a gig has an unforeseen circumstance that means they have to cancel their arrangement, DepT
serves to alleviate the stress of scouring through their contacts to find a last-minute replacement, by providing the opportunity
to quickly and easily 'dep out' gigs to the musicians using the DepT network.

Through DepT, artists can discover one another, increase revenue through their art, and build communities. 

By building communities, artists will acquire a diverse workspace and connect with a wider network.

# Overview

DepT comes from the word “to dep”, which is a term that is commonly used within the music industry to describe a musician who takes the place of a
regular band member temporarily - usually when a band member has fallen ill, has a personal issue, or more commonly has been offered a better-paid gig (such as a tour). 

The idea for the platform is born out of the personal struggle of finding last-minute “deps” outside of my immediate network.
Also, due to Covid-19, connecting with other artists and finding work has been difficult.

# UX

## Strategy

### Stakeholder Interviews

What problems/pain points do you experience when searching for a dep?

* *"My immediate network is limited by the number of musicians in my contact list"*

* *"My immediate network is limited to the locality of the area in which I live and work."*

* *"It takes a lot of time and effort to source a suitable dep, especially when the situation is time-sensitive"*

* *"A dep's availability (or lack thereof) can only be determined through a phone call or text, which is not time-effective."*

* *"A limited network of deps in the local area can result in travelling a long distance to a gig, which increases environmental impact."*

* *"There's a lack of opportunity to make myself more discoverable among a wider network of musicians."*

## Ideal Users

* Musicians/artists operating in the music industry who need to 'dep' out a gig.
* Musicians/artists operating in the music industry who are looking for job opportunities.
* Bookers/band-leaders/producers who are in need of a last-minute musician/artist to provide their services.

## Project Goal

To provide a sleek, efficient and trustworthy booking service, enabling musicians to dep out their gigs and for clients to find dep musicians, all with minimum stress.

## Structure

### Informational Architecture

#### General Considerations

To achieve an effective, intuitive architecture that is simple to navigate, there are two primary users that need to be taken into consideration:

* Members looking for work
* Members looking for a dep

Taking this into account, it is important to provide two clear paths through the website. One which suits the dep who is signing up to the service, 
and another which suits the member who is searching for a dep.

The common denominator between these two types of user is the need to view notifications and messages easily. Since the model of the website is centered around
communication (clients contacting deps and vice versa), it is of primary importance that both users are always able to keep track of when they have been contacted.
In an attempt to provide intuitive navigation in this regard, both users must have the ability to view notifications and messages from a Navigation Bar, 
which persists across all pages of the website. Furthermore, the website must provide sufficient navigational aids in the NavBar, and an abundance of 'call-to-action' buttons
which provide a clear path through the website, relative to the type of user.

#### Navbar

The navigation bar will persist across all pages of the website, allowing the user to navigate to any page with ease. 

#### Home Page

The home page is the landing page of the website. At the top level, a lead paragraph will brief the user of the clear purpose of the website.
Three call-to-action buttons will be featured:

* Sign In - Takes the user to through the website's authentication process.
* Find a Dep - Takes the user to the dep list page.
* Post a Job - Takes the user to a page to post a specific job.

The section below will display a list of links directed towards a user who is looking for a dep. These links will be categorized based
on the instrument/service that's required (Pianist, Violinist, Cellist, Drummer etc).

Another section will be present, featuring a more detailed overview of the website and testimonials.

#### Account Management

Users will be allowed to register, create an account, login, logout and reset their password.

#### Sign Up/Subscription

Following the user registering, the website's sign up process will proceed with presenting the user with two membership options:

* Tier One (Free)
* Tier Two (Paid)

Each option will detail the price, the services that the subscription offers, along with an incentive for the user to select a Tier Two membership.

Selecting Tier One will take the user directly to a page to add more details to their profile.

Selecting Tier Two will take the user through a Stripe payment procedure. 

#### Profile

At the top level, an image of the member will be presented, along with the instruments that they play, their location,
 and a call-to-action to book this member.

If the profile belongs to the user visiting, a call-to-action to edit their profile will be presented clearly.

Below, a music player will be displayed, along with a calendar of their available and unavailable dates.

Additionally, a detailed overview/pitch will be displayed (if provided by the user), along with work experience, and links to videos/recordings that they have
contributed to in the past.

On laptop/desktop devices, a sidebar will also be present with a list of reviews and star ratings (if any). This will collapse to full-width column on mobile.

#### Dashboard

The member's dashboard will present an overview of a history of any interactions/bookings through DepT.

At the top level, the user's membership status will be displayed. If they are on Tier One, an invite will be offered to the user to upgrade to Tier Two.

A list of all engagements will be present, filterable by 'past', 'invited' and 'active' engagements.
Each item in the list of engagements will be clickable, taking the user to the booking confirmation with details about the booking.

Additionally, details on profile 'completeness' will be displayed through a graphical progress bar, along with metric data of the user's number of jobs, repeat business and past clients they have worked with.

#### Find a Dep

The list of deps will be categorized by instrument/expertise, each represented by a link. For instance, a user can click a button for 'Keyboard Players', and be taken to a page listing keyboard players.
The top level will feature most common categories of instruments, such as Guitar, Drums, Bass, Keyboards or Vocals. A list of all remaining instruments will be listed below.

The dep list itself will be filterable by location, rating and availability. Each dep will be displayed on a card, along with rating, and a link to their profile.

Premium users will be given preferential treatment in the listing, being listed at the top of searches.

#### Invite Form

If a member is interested in hiring a particular dep, they can send an invite through a form. The form includes the type of engagement (such as function, festival, or studio work), the fee, the location, and setlist (if required).

#### Invite Page

If a member has been invited to a booking, they are presented with the details of the engagement, along with two buttons to either accept or deny the invite.

Additionally, the invitee and inviter will be able to message each other through this page, should there be further information required from the invited dep before booking.

#### Booking Form

If a dep has accepted an invite, the member offering the gig can use a form to provide all details pertaining to the engagement, including a file input which will handle PDFs for sheet music.

#### Booking Confirmation

Once a dep has received a confirmed booking, they will be sent an email with the full details of the engagement. This will be downloadable to a PDF format.
An email will also be sent to both parties involved in the booking.

#### Post a Job

Users wanting to post a job to the Job Page can do so through a form.

The form will prompt the user to enter the type of engagement (such as function, festival, or studio work), 
the fee, location, instrument required, and setlist (if applicable).

#### Job List Page

Premium deps will be able to view a bulletin board of jobs posted by other members. Jobs will be presented on individual cards, which open modal windows displaying information about the job.
Deps can register their interest in a particular job by messaging the member who posted the job, from the modal window. 

The member who posted the job will then receive notification of a dep's interest. The notification will prompt to either accept or decline the request, or visit the dep's profile.

## Database Structure

The project makes use of the SQlite Relational Database to handle data served throughout the website during development, and will be migrated to postgresql upon deployment.

## Surface

### Background Colours

![Colour Scheme for Background Colours of DepT Website](documentation/readme_images/colour_palette/dept_background_colours.png)

* Space Cadet (#1a2342)
    - This colour is consistently used as the background for all top-level headers throughout the website, to provide a sufficient contrast against the white text that it sits behind, while also maintaining a satisfying, reputable aesthetic.

* Independence (#45425a)
    - Used for the navigation bar, footer and header background in modal alerts, and also as the background in one mid-level section of the home page, and in modal forms (Invitation Form, Job Post Form and Review Form). This colour was chosen primarily due to it's contrast between the primary background colour (Space Cadet). Furthermore, it also provided a pleasing contrast to the foreground colours that it sits behind (white font colour, and golden colour used for rating stars). 
* White (#FFF)
    - Used for mid-level elements throughout the website, where most of the interaction takes place, and features are presented. The developer experimented with less "basic" background colours for mid-level elements to achieve a more "artistic" look, but after consideration it was determined that it was more necessary to contrast the darker, more-bold top-level elements with a more-standard colour which presented it's foreground elements sufficiently.

* Cultured (#EEE)
    - Used to provide a small contrast against the white background of some mid-level elements, such as the filter accordion (featured in the Dep List and Job List pages). This background colour is used also for the wrappers for all form elements throughout the website.

* Violet Web (#FF91EF) & Lemon (#FFF900)
    - These two colours are used in combination with a linear-gradient with an light opaque overlay. Used as the background colour for the Sign Out page, and also for the authorization flow when a user resets their password. Furthermore, this colour is used on large screens to show secondary-lead text in top-level elements of certain pages (Checkout Success, Dashboard, Edit Profile), and as the background for default card-images and user profile images in the case where a user hasn't added a profile image.

* Smoky Black (#111)
    - Used as the background colour for filter-accordions in the Dep List and Job List pages. Since the top-level header background is already rather dark, and the mid-level contrasts heavily with a sheer white, it was decided that a darker, almost black colour was required to draw the user's attention to this filter-accordion feature.

### Foreground Colours

![Colour Scheme for Foreground Colours of DepT Website](documentation/readme_images/colour_palette/dept_foreground_colours.png)

* Space Cadet (#1a2342)
    - In addition to using this colour for backgrounds, it is used as the background for some buttons throughout the website. Featured in the Edit Profile pages ('Add More Gear'/'Add More Audio' buttons), as well as buttons in metrics cards in the first section of the Dashboard page. This colour was chosen so as not to provide too much suggestivity to the role of the button, suggesting that the call-to-action is of a neutral nature.

* Sea Green (#0E8347)
    - Heavy use of this colour is made as the backgrounf for buttons throughout the website, including those to visit profiles, invite members to gigs, post jobs, leave reviews and close modal alert windows. This colour is chosen as it suggests that the call-to-action that the button represents is of a positive nature.

* Ruby Red (#9C1E1E)
    - Also used as background for buttons throughout the website, this colour is used for call-to-actions which are of an alertive nature, such as when a user decides to delete a job, invitation, profile or review. Additionally, this colour is used as the font colour for form errors.

* Bronze (#CF8036)
    - This colour is used to highlight active sections in the Dashboard 'Jobs' Page, to inform the user whether they are on a tier-one or tier-two section, and whether they are on their 'Received Invitations' or 'Sent Invitations' section. This active colour contrasts against the alternative button's black background, and will hopefully serve to clearly indicate which section of the Dashboard's Job Page the user is browsing.

* Amber (#FFC107)
    - Used for button styling on cards to display invitations sent by a user, specifically for the button inviting the user to 'Send Complete Details' for a particular invitation. This colour was chosen to indicate to the user that there is action that might need to be taken.

* Spanish Grey (#9B9A9A)
    - Used to display user details on cards displayed in the Dep List page. Since the cards are fairly small, and a relatively large amount of textual information is presented on these cards, it was deemed that this colour would serve to provide enough contrast while not busying the screen real-estate, and retaining a pleasing aesthetic.

* White (#FAFAFA)
    - Used for font colours throughout the website, in sections that use a darker background colour. Chosen primarily to provide sufficient contrast.

* Eerie Black (#202020)
     - Used for font colours that sit on top of lighter background colours, again to provide sufficient contrast.

### Logo

![Image of DepT Logo](documentation/readme_images/logo/dept-logo.png)

A simple, white-on-black logo was designed to represent the website's brand, serving to clearly present the intention of the website without any artistic frills, while also looking sleek and reliable. Displayed in the website's navbar, home page header and in authorization flows, as well as a default logo in the Booking Details/Booking Success pages, should a user profile image not be available for use. Additionally, this logo is featured on any cards in Dep List and Job List pages where a user profile image hasn't been provided.

### Typography

#### Primary Font

![Primary Font for DepT Website](documentation/readme_images/fonts/dept_primary_font.png)

The font [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans) is used for top-level header elements throughout the website, as well as modal headers, and text content on job cards.
Intended to provide some personality and sleekness against the more utilitarian fonts used for the mid-level elements, and draw the user's attention while also remaining not-too overbearing.

![Secondary Font for DepT Website](documentation/readme_images/fonts/dept_secondary_font.png)

#### Secondary Font

The font [Oxygen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen) was chosen to present the text-content of mid-level body elements of the website. Intended to provide a more functional, utilitarian feel to contrast against the more-suggestive header font, and not be too overbearing or provide congitive overload, particularly for sections of the website that contain a relatively substantial amount of text content.

![Tertiary Font for DepT Website](documentation/readme_images/fonts/dept_tertiary_font.png)

#### Tertiary Font

The font [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) was chosen to present bottom-level text content in the website's footer. Used to provide a little contrast against the secondary font, to reinforce the role of the footer while not being too contrasting.

### Header Design

![Header Design for DepT Website](documentation/readme_images/fonts/dept_tertiary_font.png)

When on large screens, many headers throughout the website are split into two halves. The left half of the header generally features header content along with any lead paragraphs, while the second half of the header, contrasting in colour, serves to act as a window, either displaying further text content (as is the case in the Dashboard and Edit Profile pages), or displaying a user's profile image (in the Profile, Booking Detail and Booking Success pages). A user's profile image is displayed as a background image on mobile/tablet devices, to retain responsivity while also maximising design flexibility.

Since the website is centered around social interaction and networking, it was deemed important that a user's profile image should be displayed in any pages which are centered around networking, such as the Profile, Booking Detail and Booking Success Page. Therefore the initial decision was made that these types of pages provide a header 'window' displaying a user's profile image. This split-header design decision was then extended throughout the headers on most other pages of the website, to provide stylistic consistency.

### Visual Effects

#### Box Shadow
The website makes heavy use of the box-shadow, primarily to present form elements and cards in Dep List and Job List pages. Since a white background is used for the body of many pages of the website, and the form elements are a lighter grey colour, a box-shadow helps to provide some depth to the light-coloured elements that sit against a white background, and make the website feel a little less two-dimensional.

#### Text Shadow
The foreground elements in pages that employ a linear gradient background colour have a slight shadow effect applied, to provide a little depth between the foreground and the background, and make the page feel more three-dimensional.

#### Colour Gradient

![Linear Gradient](documentation/readme_images/visual_effects/dept_linear_gradient.png)

A linear gradient with opaque-overlay was employed to between the colours Violet Web (#FF91EF) & Lemon (#FFF900) with, as a background colour for most pages used in the authorization flow. The decision to use this effect was purely of an aesthetic nature, in the hope that it serves to relax the user and reinforce the role of the pages, in addition to adding a little artistic flare and interest.

#### Hover Effects

Hover effects for top-level buttons are employed on large screens, which change a button's neutral off-white colour to a less neutral colour which indicates the nature of the call-to-action the button represents. Used so as not to busy the top-level with too much colour, and minimise cognitive overload.

#### Animations

Animation effects are employed in the website's 'Edit My Profile' page, used in the breadcrumb nav elements to indicate which section of the form a user is currently on. Once a user submits a section's form, the breadcrumb animates a colour fill, to indicate to the user that they have completed a section of the form page. The decision to use animated breadcrumbs should serve to make the form-filling process feel a little less mundane and boring, and provide the user with a feeling of progression.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Subscriptions

The [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb) framework provides functionality for users to subscribe to the DepT service.

The subscriptions page provides the user a choice between either subscribing as a Tier One member, or as a Tier Two member.
The subscription choices are presented on relative cards, with a list of benefits tied to each subscription tier, along with a button inviting the user to subscribe.

Upon selection of a subscription tier, the user is redirected to a Stripe checkout, where the user can enter their card details and finalize their subscription. If a user decides to cancel their subscription, they may click Stripe's 'cancel' button, and be redirected back to DepT's Home Page.

If a user has already subscribed, the subscription card which is paired with their subscription status is indicated through the text content of the card's button, which will display 'Your Current Subscription'.

If a user wishes to update their subscription plan, they may click on the alternative card's button. Upon clicking, they will be redirected to Stripe's customer portal, which keeps a track of the subscribed user's status, and allow the user to make any changes to their subscription.


### Find a Dep

This page features a collection of all members who are registered and subscribed to the platform. Each dep is presented on a card, with high-level details and average review rating displayed (in the form of star icons, and number of reviews). Each card features a button to visit the member's profile page.

The collection is filterable by:

* Instrument
    - Presented as a dropdown
* Location
    - Presented as a search text input
* Genre
    - Presented as a dropdown
* Available Today
    - Presented as a checkbox

Additionally, a visitor can sort the collection of deps by rating, from low to high and high to low.

Tier Two members have priority and are featured at the top of the list, regardless of search and sort criteria.

### Profiles

[Django Allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) is employed to handle user-management and provide authorization flow for registering, signing in, logging out, and resetting a user's password. Upon registration to the platform, a signal is sent to create a User Profile, which shares a One-To-One relationship with the auth-user model.

#### Profile Page

##### Header

![DepT Profile Header, Large Screens](documentation/readme_images/profile/dept_profile_header_lg.png)

A user's profile page serves as the base for a user to present themselves and the services they can provide, and is the first point of contact for a user who is searching for another user to play their gig.

The header of the profile page provides such details as a user's:

* Full Name
    - If no name has yet been provided, this defaults to the user's username

* Location 
    - Not displayed if no location has been provided.

* Instruments they play
    - Not displayed if no instruments have been provided.

* Review Rating (represented by stars)
    - "No Reviews" is displayed if a user has no reviews

* Profile Image
    - Defaults to the DepT Logo with a linear-gradient background if no profile image provided.

Below the header are two buttons, inviting the visiting user to either:

* Contact the user who owns the profile.
* Leave the user a review.

If user is unauthenticated, these buttons will take the user to the login page, and then will be re-directed back to the
profile page.

Furthermore, if a user doesn't have subscription status, a modal pop-up is shown, indicating that they need to subscribe in order to invite users to play gigs.

If the user visiting the profile is the profile owner, the two buttons change to invite the profile owner to either:

* Edit their Profile
* Delete their Profile

##### Body

![Dept Profile Body, Large Screens](documentation/readme_images/profile/dept_profile_body_lg.png)

The main body of the page is where the user can make their pitch, and provide an in-depth overview of their expertise and services they can provide. Reviews for a user are displayed below the user's pitch. The body also features the an interactive music player, which the visiting user can use to sample any music the profile owner has uploaded to their profile. 

Additionally, a calendar is featured displaying the user's unavailable dates (marked in a light red colour), so the visiting user can quickly determine whether the profile owner will be available to play a gig. 

Below the music player and calendar, a small list of the user's Genre expertise is displayed, along with any equipment information they would like to submit. 

The music player, calendar, genre list and equipment list are displayed as a sidebar on large screens, and collapse to full-width columns on tablet and mobile devices.

##### Modals

###### Invitation Modal
Should a user visiting the profile decide they want to invite the profile owner to play a gig. They may click a button to open a modal window to send an Invitation. Here they can provide gig details such as:

* Event Name
* Artist Name
* Event City
* Event Country
* Date and Time of the Event
* The Fee
* Additional Information

Form validation is provided using AJAX. 

The invitation modal is accessible only to members who have subscribed to the platform.

###### Review Modal
Should a user like to leave a review to the profile owner, they may click on a button to open a modal window to leave a review. The form features clickable star icons to leave a rating from 1-5, and submit text content using the text area provided in the form.

#### Edit Profile Page

A registered user can access a page where they can edit their personal and profile details. This page is split into three sections:

* Personal Details
    - Here the user can provide their name, location, instruments and genres of expertise, a list of their equipment, and a textarea where they may provided a detailed overview of their expertise, and make their pitch.

    Should the user decide they want to make a change, the initial data they provided will be presented as values in all
    the relevant fields when they next visit the page.

* Audio Files
    - Here the user may upload any audio files that they believe may be of interest to other users of the website.
    The Graphical User Interface is in the form of a drag-and-drop window (provided by [DropzoneJS](https://www.dropzone.dev/js/)), where users can choose to either click the window to open their file system and choose files manually, or drag and drop their files into the window. Upon loading of an audiofile, a widget is shown, displaying the name of the audio file they have added, and their filesize. 

    Files no larger than 5MB may be uploaded.

     Should the user decide they want to delete a file, the initial audio files they provided will be presented as widgets in the GUI, with an option to remove the file presented below the GUI.

* Unavailable Dates
    - The third and final form of the Edit Profile Page features a GUI calendar (provided by [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/)), where users can submit dates where they are unavailable. Users can interact with the calendar by cycling through each month (by clicking the caret buttons in the top right corner of the header), and clicking on dates where they are unavailable. Upon clicking a particular date, the background colour of the date they clicked will turn a light red, to indicate that this date has been selected, and provide feedback to the user.

    Should the user like to de-select a date, they may click the date again, which will remove the date from the collection to be submitted, and return the colour of the date to a white colour.

    If the user wants to make a change after submitting the form, all dates they have already selected will be presented as initial data on the calendar.

##### Breadcrumbs

Considering that the form is split into three pages, it was deemed necessary to provide breadcrumb navigation so that the user can feel some progression in what might feel like a long, drawn-out process, and provide a feeling that they are working towards a goal. 

Upon submission of each form, the breadcrumbs animate, and are filled with a green colour to indicate to the user that they have just completed a form section. On large screens, the breadcrumbs are presented as text. When collapsing to small screens, 
the text content is replaced with FontAwesome icons, to visually represent the purpose of each form page.

##### Skip Step/Go Back Buttons

Users have the option to skip a step, or return to a previous form page at their will. If the user chooses to skip a step instead of submitting a form, the breadcrumbs will not animate and fill with colour.

#### Dashboard

Each registered user has access to a dashboard. The top level header features a navigation bar with links to:

* **Dashboard**
* **Jobs**
* **Your Membership**

The 'Dashboard' and 'Jobs' links take the user to the respective child-pages of the parent 'Dashboard' page, while the 'Your Membership' link takes the user to the page to choose their subscription.

#### Page One

The first child page of the dashboard page features the user's profile metrics, such as:

* Their subscription status
* Invitations they have yet to respond to
* How complete their profile is (represented as a progress bar)
* Their average rating

Each item of metric data is presented as a card, with a call-to-action below each item. If a user has Tier One status, a list of Tier Two benefits and a button is presented, inviting them to upgrade their subscription. If a user has not yet subscribed, they are presented with a card inviting them to subscribe so that they can appear in searches and invite other members to jobs.

 If a user hasn't completed their profile, a call-to-action is presented to visit their Edit Profile page to complete their profile. 

 If a user has some invites they need to respond to, a call-to-action is presented, inviting the user to visit their Jobs page and respond to their pending invites.
 
Lastly, if a user has no reviews, a button is provided to take the user to the DepList page, to 'meet the community'. 

#### Jobs Page

The second child page of the Dashboard page is where the user can keep track of their active jobs. This page is split into two sections, "Tier One" and "Tier Two", which are accessible through navigation buttons.

##### Tier One

The Tier One section displays all invitations a user has sent or received. These two criteria are split into respective sections:

* Invitations Sent
* Invitations Received 

Each section is accessible through navigation buttons.

Both sent and received invitations are filterable by:

* All
* Pending
* Confirmed

The invitations themselves are presented as cards, featuring the high-level details of a particular engagement.

All cards for invitations that have been sent and pending a response, feature buttons for the user to edit or delete their invitation. 

All cards for invitations that have been received and pending a response, feature buttons for the invited user to either accept or decline an invitation.

If an invitation receiver has accepted an invitation, the card presenting that particular invitation then features a button to 'Send Complete Details', and take the invitation sender to a booking form, where they can finalize their booking.

Once an invitation receiver has accepted an invitation, a disabled button is presented informing that the accepted invitation is 'Waiting for Details'. Once the invitation sender has finalized the booking, the disabled button is replaced with a button to 'View Full Details', which takes the user to a Booking Detail page.

Both invitation senders and invitation receivers involved in an active engagement are able to message eachother about the engagement, by opening a modal chat window from clicking a button "Message <user>". Any messages that have been previously sent will persist, and be displayed in the modal window upon a later visit. 

##### Tier Two (Premium)

The Tier Two section displays all information about any jobs a Tier Two member has posted or made an offer for. Similarly to the Tier One section these two criteria are split into respective sections:

* Posted Jobs
* Offers Sent

Each section is accessible through navigation buttons.

Simlarly to Tier One, posted jobs and offers-sent are filterable by:

* All
* Pending
* Confirmed

Jobs are also presented on cards, featuring high-level details about the job the user has posted, or a job they have made an offer to play.

If the user has posted a job, the card displays information on how many other users are interested in taking the job. Clickable avatars of the interested members are displayed, which are linked to their respective profiles. A button is also displayed inviting the job poster to 'Choose a Member'. This opens a modal window displaying a list of all users who have expressed interest in taking a job. From here, the Job Poster can select one of the members to take the job.

If no offers have been made for the job, the 'Choose a Member' button is replaced with a disabled button displaying text content 'No Offers Received.

If a Job Poster has not yet chosen a member to take the job, they can either delete or edit their invitation, using buttons presented on the card.

Once a Job Poster has confirmed a member a line of communication is opened, and the Job Poster/Confirmed Member can exchange messages by use of a chat modal window, accessible through a button "Message <user>", displayed on a card. The list of avatars is replaced with an avatar of the confirmed member. Furthermore, similarly to the Tier One booking flow, the Job Poster is presented with a button to 'Send Complete Details', which takes them to a page to finalize their booking.

If a user has sent an offer to play a job that another user has posted, and has been confirmed, they are presented with a disabled button with text content 'Awaiting Full Details'. Once the Job Poster has finalized the booking through the booking form, this button is replaced with a button to 'View Full Details'.

Note, the Tier Two section is only accessible to users who have a Tier Two subscription.

### Find a Job

This page features a collection of all jobs that have been posted by members using the Tier Two service. 

A button is displayed in the page's header, inviting a user to 'Post a Job'. This triggers a modal window with a form for the user to provide details about the job, which will then be displayed on a card below. If a Tier One user clicks this button, an alert modal is displayed informing the user that they need to subscribe to Tier Two to post a job.

Similarly to the 'Find a Dep' page, all jobs are presented on individual cards, which high-level information about the job, and an image representing the artist or nature of the job that has been posted. Visual indicators are displayed to represent how lucrative the job is, by way of dollar signs (one dollar sign being not very lucrative, and five dollar signs being very lucrative).

The cards feature two buttons:

* View Details
    - Opens a modal window displaying further details about a job.

* Make An Offer
    - A user can click this button to register interest in taking this job.
    - If clicked, the user can 'Remove the Offer' by clicking the same button.
    - This feature is only accessible for Tier Two users.

 As with the 'Find a Dep' page, Jobs are filterable by:

 * Location
    - Presented as a search text input
* Fee Range
    - Presented as a select dropdown

### Booking Form

For Tier One or Tier Two users who have confirmed a member on their posted job, or had their invitation accepted, they can visit a booking form where they can finalize their booking. 

Here they are prompted to provide the venue address, any audio resources that would be useful for the acquired dep to peruse, and any travel or backline information.

Django's ``modelformset_factory`` is employed to dynamically add extra audio file fields to the form, should the user wish to provide more than one audio file. A maximum of five audio files can be added.

### Booking Details

The booking details page is shared between both Tier One and Tier Two engagements.

Once a booking has been finalized, both the invitation sender/invitation receiver (Tier One) or job_poster/confirmed_member (Tier Two) can visit this page to browse the finalized details of a given booking. 

If the invitation receiver/confirmed member is visiting this page, they are presented with two buttons to:

* Download the Booking Details as PDF
    - Useful if the venue the event is taking place might be in an area with no internet.

* Download any audio files that have been submitted, if any.

### Notifications

Notifications are in important aspect of a social networking website such as DepT. With this, there is a notification dropdown
which persists across all pages within the website's navigation bar. The dropdown button is represented with a bell icon, along with a Bootstrap 'badge', which displayed how many notifications a user has been sent.

Notifications to a user are sent in the following events:

#### Tier One

* A user has received an invitation from another user.
* A user has accepted another user's invitation.
* A user has received a message about an active engagement.
* A user has accepted another user's invitation.
* A user has received booking details for an accepted invitation.
* A user has decline another user's invitation.

#### Tier Two
* A user has registered interest in another user's posted job.
* A user who has registered interest in a posted job has been confirmed.
* A user has received booking details for a confirmed job.
* A user has received a message about a confirmed job.

Both Tier One and Tier Two users are sent notifications whenever they receive a review.

### Responsive Design

The Bootstrap framework was used to provide responsivity across all device screen sizes, using their pre-defined 
widths from 320px and up. Additionally, heavy use of CSS media queries have been made to re-arrange and re-style certain header and navigation elements featured in the website, and to ensure that the website is also responsive on extra large screens. 

All screen sizes have been taken into consideration when developing the website, to maximise responsivity and ensure a positive user-experience across all screen sizes.

## Features For Future Implementation

### Aynschronous Messaging and Notifications

In the initial planning stages of the website's development lifecycle, the developer embarked on tutorials in creating a chat service using the [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) integration, which uses web sockets and asynchronous functions to provide real-time messaging. The developer sought to include this functionality in the MVP of the original website, and extend this functionality to offering users real-time notifications.

However, it was later discovered that this was all well and good on a development server, but deploying an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) is rather a lot more involved than deploying on a standard Web Server Gateway Interface, which the developer was more familiar with. 

In the interests of time, and taking into consideration the priority of the other features that were central to the website, the developer determined that it was best to focus on the features to achieve a Minimal Viable Product. It is the developer's intention to undergo further research and practice to integrate asynchronous web sockets, and allow for real time message and notifications.

### Google Calendar API Integration

In the case of users adding their unavailable dates, the present deployment of the website requires that users update their unavailability calendar manually, which means they have to remember to log in, cycle through their calendar, and submit their unavailable dates each time they have receive a job either due to, or in spite of, the DepT service.

With this in mind, it would be useful to integrate the Google Calendar API, so the user's unavailability calendar is updated automatically whenever they add a job to their calendar in Google. This would most likely substantially improve the UX of DepT, as users would benefit from less manual labour when using the service.

It is the developer's intention to implement this functionality for future releases.

### Customised Emails with Attachments

At present, emails sent to a user (for accepted invitations/booking details that have been sent), have no customizing or branding, and are presented in their most-basic format. Furthermore, there are no options to add attachments for PDF or audio files. It would serve a better UX if emails were branded and more functional, and it would reinforce trust in the DepT brand.
With this, it is important to customize and enhance the emailing service in future releases.

### Sheet Music Resources

It was the developer's original intention to provide the option for users to submit sheet music (as PDF files) in the website's Booking Form when finalizing an accepted booking/confirmed job. However, the time it took to develop the other features of the website meant that this was neglected in favour of developing the core aspects of the website in order to reach a Minimal Viable Product. Once the project is submitted, the developer will create a new branch on the repository, and implement this functionality for the next release.
