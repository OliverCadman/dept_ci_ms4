# DepT - A platform created by artists, for artists.

Dept is a full-stack, community-led, subscription-based platform allowing musicians and artists to advertise their skills and services
to band leaders, producers, other artists, or any client that requires a last-minute musician to provide a service.

If a musician booked for a gig has an unforeseen circumstance that means they have to cancel their arrangement, DepT
serves to alleviate the stress of scouring through their contacts to find a last-minute replacement, by providing the opportunity
to quickly and easily 'dep out' gigs to the musicians using the DepT network.

Through DepT, artists can discover one another, increase revenue through their art, and build communities. 

By building communities, artists will acquire a diverse workspace and connect with a wider network.

# Overview

DepT comes from the word “to dep”, which is a term that is commonly used within the music industry to describe a musician who takes the place of a
regular band member temporarily - usually when a band member has fallen ill, has a personal issue, or more commonly has been offered a better-paid gig (such as a tour). 

The idea for the platform is born out of the personal struggle of finding last-minute “deps” outside of my immediate network.
Also, due to Covid-19, connecting with other artists and finding work has been difficult.

# UX

## Strategy

### Stakeholder Interviews

What problems/pain points do you experience when searching for a dep?

* *"My immediate network is limited by the number of musicians in my contact list"*

* *"My immediate network is limited to the locality of the area in which I live and work."*

* *"It takes a lot of time and effort to source a suitable dep, especially when the situation is time-sensitive"*

* *"A dep's availability (or lack thereof) can only be determined through a phone call or text, which is not time-effective."*

* *"A limited network of deps in the local area can result in travelling a long distance to a gig, which increases environmental impact."*

* *"There's a lack of opportunity to make myself more discoverable among a wider network of musicians."*

## Ideal Users

* Musicians/artists operating in the music industry who need to 'dep' out a gig.
* Musicians/artists operating in the music industry who are looking for job opportunities.
* Bookers/band-leaders/producers who are in need of a last-minute musician/artist to provide their services.

## Project Goal

To provide a sleek, efficient and trustworthy booking service, enabling musicians to dep out their gigs and for clients to find dep musicians, all with minimum stress.

## Structure

### Informational Architecture

#### General Considerations

To achieve an effective, intuitive architecture that is simple to navigate, there are two primary users that need to be taken into consideration:

* Members looking for work
* Members looking for a dep

Taking this into account, it is important to provide two clear paths through the website. One which suits the dep who is signing up to the service, 
and another which suits the member who is searching for a dep.

The common denominator between these two types of user is the need to view notifications and messages easily. Since the model of the website is centered around
communication (clients contacting deps and vice versa), it is of primary importance that both users are always able to keep track of when they have been contacted.
In an attempt to provide intuitive navigation in this regard, both users must have the ability to view notifications and messages from a Navigation Bar, 
which persists across all pages of the website. Furthermore, the website must provide sufficient navigational aids in the NavBar, and an abundance of 'call-to-action' buttons
which provide a clear path through the website, relative to the type of user.

#### Navbar

The navigation bar will persist across all pages of the website, allowing the user to navigate to any page with ease. 

#### Home Page

The home page is the landing page of the website. At the top level, a lead paragraph will brief the user of the clear purpose of the website.
Three call-to-action buttons will be featured:

* Sign In - Takes the user to through the website's authentication process.
* Find a Dep - Takes the user to the dep list page.
* Post a Job - Takes the user to a page to post a specific job.

The section below will display a list of links directed towards a user who is looking for a dep. These links will be categorized based
on the instrument/service that's required (Pianist, Violinist, Cellist, Drummer etc).

Another section will be present, featuring a more detailed overview of the website and testimonials.

#### Account Management

Users will be allowed to register, create an account, login, logout and reset their password.

#### Sign Up/Subscription

Following the user registering, the website's sign up process will proceed with presenting the user with two membership options:

* Tier One (Free)
* Tier Two (Paid)

Each option will detail the price, the services that the subscription offers, along with an incentive for the user to select a Tier Two membership.

Selecting Tier One will take the user directly to a page to add more details to their profile.

Selecting Tier Two will take the user through a Stripe payment procedure. 

#### Profile

At the top level, an image of the member will be presented, along with the instruments that they play, their location,
 and a call-to-action to book this member.

If the profile belongs to the user visiting, a call-to-action to edit their profile will be presented clearly.

Below, a music player will be displayed, along with a calendar of their available and unavailable dates.

Additionally, a detailed overview/pitch will be displayed (if provided by the user), along with work experience, and links to videos/recordings that they have
contributed to in the past.

On laptop/desktop devices, a sidebar will also be present with a list of reviews and star ratings (if any). This will collapse to full-width column on mobile.

#### Dashboard

The member's dashboard will present an overview of a history of any interactions/bookings through DepT.

At the top level, the user's membership status will be displayed. If they are on Tier One, an invite will be offered to the user to upgrade to Tier Two.

A list of all engagements will be present, filterable by 'past', 'invited' and 'active' engagements.
Each item in the list of engagements will be clickable, taking the user to the booking confirmation with details about the booking.

Additionally, details on profile 'completeness' will be displayed through a graphical progress bar, along with metric data of the user's number of jobs, repeat business and past clients they have worked with.

#### Find a Dep

The list of deps will be categorized by instrument/expertise, each represented by a link. For instance, a user can click a button for 'Keyboard Players', and be taken to a page listing keyboard players.
The top level will feature most common categories of instruments, such as Guitar, Drums, Bass, Keyboards or Vocals. A list of all remaining instruments will be listed below.

The dep list itself will be filterable by location, rating and availability. Each dep will be displayed on a card, along with rating, and a link to their profile.

Premium users will be given preferential treatment in the listing, being listed at the top of searches.

#### Invite Form

If a member is interested in hiring a particular dep, they can send an invite through a form. The form includes the type of engagement (such as function, festival, or studio work), the fee, the location, and setlist (if required).

#### Invite Page

If a member has been invited to a booking, they are presented with the details of the engagement, along with two buttons to either accept or deny the invite.

Additionally, the invitee and inviter will be able to message each other through this page, should there be further information required from the invited dep before booking.

#### Booking Form

If a dep has accepted an invite, the member offering the gig can use a form to provide all details pertaining to the engagement, including a file input which will handle PDFs for sheet music.

#### Booking Confirmation

Once a dep has received a confirmed booking, they will be sent an email with the full details of the engagement. This will be downloadable to a PDF format.
An email will also be sent to both parties involved in the booking.

#### Post a Job

Users wanting to post a job to the Job Page can do so through a form.

The form will prompt the user to enter the type of engagement (such as function, festival, or studio work), 
the fee, location, instrument required, and setlist (if applicable).

#### Job List Page

Premium deps will be able to view a bulletin board of jobs posted by other members. Jobs will be presented on individual cards, which open modal windows displaying information about the job.
Deps can register their interest in a particular job by messaging the member who posted the job, from the modal window. 

The member who posted the job will then receive notification of a dep's interest. The notification will prompt to either accept or decline the request, or visit the dep's profile.

## Database Structure

The project makes use of the SQlite Relational Database to handle data served throughout the website during development, and will be migrated to postgresql upon deployment.
