# DepT - A platform created by artists, for artists.

Dept is a full-stack, community-led, subscription-based platform allowing musicians and artists to advertise their skills and services
to band leaders, producers, other artists, or any client that requires a last-minute musician to provide a service.

If a musician booked for a gig has an unforeseen circumstance that means they have to cancel their arrangement, DepT
serves to alleviate the stress of scouring through their contacts to find a last-minute replacement, by providing the opportunity
to quickly and easily 'dep out' gigs to the musicians using the DepT network.

Through DepT, artists can discover one another, increase revenue through their art, and build communities. 

By building communities, artists will acquire a diverse work space and connect with a wider network.

# Overview

DepT comes from the word “to dep”, which is a term that is commonly used within the music industry to describe a musician who takes the place of a
regular band member temporarily - usually when a band member has fallen ill, has a personal issue, or more commonly has been offered a better paid gig (such as a tour). 

The idea for the platform is born out of the personal struggle of finding last-minute “deps” outside of my immediate network.
Also, due to Covid-19, connecting with other artists and finding work has been difficult.
