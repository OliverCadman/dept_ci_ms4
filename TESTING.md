# Markup Validation

## HTML

The [W3C HTML Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the website's HTML files.

All the following pages passed with no issues:

* Home Page
* Find a Dep
* Find a Job
* Dashboard
* Edit Invitation
* Edit Job
* Sign Out
* Login
* Register
* Reset Password (all pages of reset-password authorization flow)
* Booking Success
* Booking Detail
* Edit Profile

While these pages passed with no errors, issues were encountered on these pages:

* Subscription Page
* Profile Page

### HTML Validation Issues

Unfortunately, HTML validation errors were thrown when upon validating HTML generated automatically by third-party packages.

#### Subscription Page

The [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) JS library is imported via a CDN in a script tag, to provide functionality to the website's subscription page.

Upon validating this page, errors were thrown due to Stripe's automatically-generated iframe.

![Stripe Validation Errors](documentation/readme_images/validation/stripe_validation_errors.png)

The developer went to great lengths to try and find a way to rectify this error, so that the page would pass validation with a clean sheet. However much to their frustration, they were unable to find a suitable method to successfully alter how Stripe's ``iframe`` attributes are rendered.

#### Profile Page

Similarly to the issues faced by a third-party package in the Subscription page, issues were faced when validating the automatically-generated HTML table, generating by the [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) API.

Upon validating the HTML code for the Profile page, many errors were thrown due to the semantics used in FullCalendar's automatically-generated calendar.

![FullCalendar Validation Errors](documentation/readme_images/validation/fullcalendar_validation_errors.png)

Errors and warnings of this nature are present for every ``td`` element used in their calendar. Again, the developer made great efforts to research and find a way to solve this issue so the calendar passed validation with a clean sheet. 

Initially, the developer deducted that they could download the library and add it to their project without CDN, and edit the JavaScript file to remove the offending attributes of the table elements. However, the website offers no support for downloading the package. Users can only use FullCalendar via CDN or as an NPM package.

Much to the developer's frustration and dejection, no success was had in finding a way to alter the table element's attributes in order to pass validation with no errors. 

Short of researching and integrating a completely new calendar library, or removing the calendar feature from the website altogether, a useful solution could not be found in time before project submission.

#### Overview

The developer's HTML code was validated throughout the lifecycle of the project's development, and has passed all validator tests with no errors shown.

All errors and warnings that were thrown by the validator are a direct result of the third-party packages used by the website. The developer is aware that regardless of whether they wrote the code or not, using a third-party package that generates unsemantic code isn't a good practice. 

Careful consideration will be made in the developer's future, when choosing third-party packages to use in their websites.

## CSS

The [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the website's CSS files.

All CSS files passed validation tests with no issues.

At the time of deployment, there are 36 warnings:

1. Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes.
    * Accounts for 1 of the 36 warnings

2. <extension> is an unknown vendor extension
    * Accounts for 35 of 36 warnings

Since these warnings are a result of W3C Jigsaws inability to interpret them by default,
the developer is satisfied that the warnings can be dismissed.

## PEP8 Compliancy

All custom Python code was validated for PEP8 Compliancy using the [pep8online validator](http://pep8online.com/)

The following files have been checked for validation:

* Root
    * custom_storages.py
    * test_helpers.py

    * test_urls.py
    * test_views.py
    * urls.py
    * views.py

Social
    * admin.py

    * urls.py
    * views.py

Subscriptions
    * tests.py
    * urls.py
    * views.py
    * webhook_handler.py

At the time of deployment, there are no validation errors in any files listed.

## JS Validation

The project's JavaScript files are validated by [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

The following files have been ran through the JSHint Validator:

* Root Static JS
    * ajax_error_message.js
    * delete_alert_modals.js
    * form_ajax.js
    * format_date.js
    * notification.js
    * toastify.js 
* Bookings
    * booking_form.js
    * rating.js
* Home
    * index.js
* Jobs
    * filter.js
    * job_detail_modal.js
    * job_fee_icons.js
* Profiles
    * audio_dropzone.js
    * bar-ui.js
    * calendar_profile.js
    * calendar.js
    * dashboard_modals.js
    * display_star_rating.js
    * edit_review_modals.js
    * formset.js
    * progress_bar.js
    * soundmanager.js
    * switch_form_pages.js
* Subscriptions
    * checkout.js

## Unused/Undefined Variables

JSHint threw warnings related to the use of unused/undefined variables.

###Â Unused Variables

The following custom functions are the "unused variables" flagged by JSHint:

* ``displayAJAXErrorMessage()``
    * Defined in it's own file and shared among JavaScript files which use AJAX to communicate with the backend.

* ``formatDate()``
    * Defined in it's own file and shared in `dashboard_modals.js`

* ``dateDiffInDays()``
    *  Defined in it's own file and shared in `dashboard_modals.js`

* ``displayToast()``
    * Defined in it's own file and shared among various JavaScript files which required toasts to be displayed (principally in AJAX success callbacks).

These functions are defined in a seperate file to keep the workspace clean, and are used across other files involved in the project. Though the functions aren't being used in the file they are defined in, it is indeed being used in other files of the project.

### Undefined Variables

The following custom functions and variables are the "undefined variables" flagged by JSHint:

* ``displayToast()``
    * Defined in a seperate file.

* ``displayAJAXErrorMessage()``
    * Defined in a seperate file.

* ``mediaUrl``
    * Define in script tags in 'base.html'

* ``formatDate()``
    * Defined in another file

* ``dateDiffInDays``
    * Define in another file

The following variables and functions are provided by third-party CDNs:

* `Stripe`

* `Toastify`

* `FullCalendar`

* `Dropzone`

Since the custom variables and functions are defined in a seperate file to keep a clean workspace, JSHint of course will assume that they are not being used if it cannot find a reference to the variable/function in the same file.

Similarly with variables and functions provided via CDN link, JSHint won't be aware of their definition since it doesn't have access to the files provided via CDN.

With this, the developer is satisfied that these warnings can be dismissed.
