# Markup Validation

## HTML

The [W3C HTML Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the website's HTML files.

All the following pages passed with no issues:

- Home Page
- Find a Dep
- Find a Job
- Dashboard
- Edit Invitation
- Edit Job
- Sign Out
- Login
- Register
- Reset Password (all pages of reset-password authorization flow)
- Booking Success
- Booking Detail
- Edit Profile

While these pages passed with no errors, issues were encountered on these pages:

- Subscription Page
- Profile Page

### HTML Validation Issues

Unfortunately, HTML validation errors were thrown when upon validating HTML generated automatically by third-party packages.

#### Subscription Page

##### Stripe Validation Errors (Rectified)

The [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com) JS library is imported via a CDN in a script tag, to provide functionality to the website's subscription page.

Upon validating this page, errors were thrown due to Stripe's automatically-generated iframe.

![Stripe Validation Errors](documentation/readme_images/validation/stripe_validation_errors.png)

The developer was able to rectify this error by creating some custom JavaScript to edit the `name` attribute of the iframe, and remove the prepended underscore.
They also removed the `frameborder`, `allowtransparency` and `scrolling` attributes which were offending the W3C HTML Validator.

The code used is thus:

```
$(document).ready(function () {
        const stripeIFrame = $("iframe");
        let stripeIFrameNameAttr = stripeIFrame.attr("name");
        stripeIFrameNameAttr = stripeIFrameNameAttr.split("_")[2];
        stripeIFrame.attr("name", stripeIFrameNameAttr);
        stripeIFrame.removeAttr("frameborder");
        stripeIFrame.removeAttr("allowtransparency");
        stripeIFrame.removeAttr("scrolling");
    });
```

This effectively removed the offending attributes of the Stripe iframe, and allowed the Subscription page to pass W3C Validation with no errors.

#### Profile Page

##### Full Calendar Validation Errors

##### "Role" Attributes on td, tr, and tbody elements (rectified)

Similarly to the issues faced by a third-party package in the Subscription page, issues were faced when validating the automatically-generated HTML table, generating by the [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) API.

Upon validating the HTML code for the Profile page, many errors were thrown due to the semantics used in _FullCalendar_'s automatically-generated calendar.

![FullCalendar Validation Errors](documentation/readme_images/validation/fullcalendar_validation_errors.png)

Errors and warnings of this nature are present for every `td` element used in their calendar. Again, the developer made great efforts to research and find a way to solve this issue so the calendar passed validation with a clean sheet.

Initially, the developer deducted that they could download the library and add it to their project without CDN, and edit the JavaScript file to remove the offending attributes of the table elements. However, the website offers no support for downloading the package. Users can only use _FullCalendar_ via CDN or as an NPM package.

The developer was able to rectify some, but not all of the errors. They created custom JavaScript code to remove the `role` attributes from all `td`, `tr` and `tbody` elements generated by _FullCalendar_:

```
    const tableDataCells = document.querySelectorAll("td");
    for (let cell of tableDataCells) {
      cell.removeAttribute("role");
    }

    const tableRows = document.querySelectorAll("tr");
    for (let row of tableRows) {
      row.removeAttribute("role");
    }

    const tableBody = document.querySelector("tbody");
    tableBody.removeAttribute("role");
  }
```

This effectively removed the offending attributes from the _FullCalendar_ table, and allowed these elements to pass the W3C HTML Validator with no errors.

##### FullCalendar Table Markup Errors

![Screenshot of FullCalendar Validation Errors](documentation/readme_images/validation/fullcalendar_validation_errors_2.png)

However, there is another error being thrown, which seems to reference the very structure of the table that _FullCalendar_ generates:

`A table row was 7 columns wide and exceeded the column count established using column markup (1).`

Since this error involves the structure of the table itself, it's beyond the scope of the developer's current skillset to find a way to create custom JS code which can alter the HTML structure of a table generated by a third-party package. If the developer had more time before submission, they would undergo further research and find a sure-fire way to edit FullCalendar's HTML Calendar structure, and rectify this error.

Though sadly at the present moment, as much as they'd like to pass the W3C Validator with a clean sheet, it's with a heavy heart that they had to admit defeat with regards to this particular error.

Short of researching and integrating a completely new calendar library, or removing the calendar feature from the website altogether, a useful solution could not be found in time before project submission.

#### Overview

The developer's HTML code was validated throughout the lifecycle of the project's development, and has passed all validator tests with no errors shown.

All errors and warnings that were thrown by the validator are a direct result of the third-party packages used by the website. The developer is aware that regardless of whether they wrote the code or not, using a third-party package that generates unsemantic code isn't a good practice.

Careful consideration will be made in the developer's future, when choosing third-party packages to use in their websites.

## CSS

The [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the website's CSS files.

All CSS files passed validation tests with no issues.

At the time of deployment, there are 36 warnings:

1. Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes.

   - Accounts for 1 of the 36 warnings

2. <extension> is an unknown vendor extension
   - Accounts for 35 of 36 warnings

Since these warnings are a result of W3C Jigsaws inability to interpret them by default,
the developer is satisfied that the warnings can be dismissed.

## PEP8 Compliancy

All custom Python code was validated for PEP8 Compliancy using the [pep8online validator](http://pep8online.com/)

The following files have been checked for validation:

- Root

  - custom_storages.py
  - test_helpers.py
  -

- Bookings

At the time of deployment, there are no validation errors in any files listed.

## JS Validation

The project's JavaScript files are validated by [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

The following files have been ran through the JSHint Validator:

- Root Static JS
  - ajax_error_message.js
  - delete_alert_modals.js
  - form_ajax.js
  - format_date.js
  - notification.js
  - toastify.js
- Bookings
  - booking_form.js
  - rating.js
- Home
  - index.js
- Jobs
  - filter.js
  - job_detail_modal.js
  - job_fee_icons.js
- Profiles
  - audio_dropzone.js
  - bar-ui.js
  - calendar_profile.js
  - calendar.js
  - dashboard_modals.js
  - display_star_rating.js
  - edit_review_modals.js
  - formset.js
  - progress_bar.js
  - soundmanager.js
  - switch_form_pages.js
- Subscriptions
  - checkout.js

## Unused/Undefined Variables

JSHint threw warnings related to the use of unused/undefined variables.

###Â Unused Variables

The following custom functions are the "unused variables" flagged by JSHint:

- `displayAJAXErrorMessage()`

  - Defined in it's own file and shared among JavaScript files which use AJAX to communicate with the backend.

- `formatDate()`

  - Defined in it's own file and shared in `dashboard_modals.js`

- `dateDiffInDays()`

  - Defined in it's own file and shared in `dashboard_modals.js`

- `displayToast()`
  - Defined in it's own file and shared among various JavaScript files which required toasts to be displayed (principally in AJAX success callbacks).

These functions are defined in a seperate file to keep the workspace clean, and are used across other files involved in the project. Though the functions aren't being used in the file they are defined in, it is indeed being used in other files of the project.

### Undefined Variables

The following custom functions and variables are the "undefined variables" flagged by JSHint:

- `displayToast()`

  - Defined in a seperate file.

- `displayAJAXErrorMessage()`

  - Defined in a seperate file.

- `mediaUrl`

  - Define in script tags in 'base.html'

- `formatDate()`

  - Defined in another file

- `dateDiffInDays`
  - Define in another file

The following variables and functions are provided by third-party CDNs:

- `Stripe`

- `Toastify`

- `FullCalendar`

- `Dropzone`

Since the custom variables and functions are defined in a seperate file to keep a clean workspace, JSHint of course will assume that they are not being used if it cannot find a reference to the variable/function in the same file.

Similarly with variables and functions provided via CDN link, JSHint won't be aware of their definition since it doesn't have access to the files provided via CDN.

With this, the developer is satisfied that these warnings can be dismissed.

# Automated Testing

Automated Unit Testing was employed during the development of the project. [Django's Test Suite](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/testing/) was used to perform unit tests of the views, models and urls of each app.

A total of 113 Unit tests were created and performed, in an effort to cover all individual views GET and POST methods, along with all urls, models and forms related to each application.

Unfortunately due to time constraints, it was not possible to cover all aspects of every application of the project individually.

However, the views of each app are all tested extensively, which helped to cover testing of many URL and model operations.

Below is an itemised list of the each app and the test files associated with them.

## Home

- [Test Views](home/test_views.py)
- [Test URLs](home/test_urls.py)

## Bookings

- [Test Views](bookings/test_views.py)
- [Test Forms](bookings/test_forms.py)

## Jobs

- [Test Models](jobs/test_models.py)
- [Test Views](jobs/test_views.py)

## Profiles

- [Test Models](profiles/test_models.py)
- [Test Views](profiles/test_views.py)
- [Test URLs](profiles/test_urls.py)

## Social

- [Test Models](social/test_models.py)
- [Test Views](social/test_views.py)

## Subscriptions

- [Test Views](subscriptions/test_views.py)

### Result

All 113 tests that were performed passed with no errors or failures.

## Test Coverage

To achieve maximum test coverage across the applications of the project, Python's [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.2/)
library was used.

The coverage report returned **93%** coverage across the application. Below is a screen shot of the latest coverage report.

![Screenshot of DepT Testing Coverage Report](documentation/readme_images/coverage/test_coverage_report.png)

### Issues Testing Exceptions/Webhooks

Efforts were made to test the project's exception handlers, as well as the Stripe webhooks.

Upon research, it was found that using Python's [unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) library could be employed. By using the unittest.mock `@patch` decorator, one may add a `side_effect` to mock an Exception in a view.

Similarly, mock patch can mock a call to a third-party API such as Stripe, in order to test their webhooks and customer management.

However, after attempting to implement these tests in a number of permutations, the developer wasn't able to return accurate results.

To account for this, extensive manual testing was employed, particularly in order to test Stripe functionality when using it's checkout and customer portal.

# Lighthouse Testing

Google Chromeâs âLighthouseâ extension for its DevTools feature was used to test the websiteâs Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and Search Engine Optimisation. Listed below are the latest reports from Lighthouseâs run of testing:

## Performance/Best Practice Issues - Attempts To Rectify

The principal warning that was thrown by Google Lighthouse was generally related to the performance of pages, specifically the 'Largest Contentful Paint'.

The warnings that lighthouse flagged read `serve images in next-gen formats`.

When the developer first encountered this issue, they understood that they couldn't particularly control what kind of image format a user may upload, when choosing a profile image, or an image to display in a job post.

With this in mind, the developer attempted to implement some backend functionality which converted any saved profile-image objects to a webp format.

The code that was written was thus, (referenced from https://www.webucator.com/tutorial/using-python-to-convert-images-to-webp/):

```
def convert_to_webp(source):
    """Convert image to WebP.

    Args:
        source (pathlib.Path): Path to source image

    Returns:
        pathlib.Path: path to new image
    """
    destination = source.with_suffix(".webp")

    image = Image.open(source)  # Open image
    image.save(destination, format="webp")  # Convert image to webp

    return destination
```

This solution was effective, but only when rendering on the client-side, when the images are being served. While this is a solution, it would certainly impact heavily on performance if there were hundreds of members featured on a page. Should many profile images need to be converted, performance would certainly suffer.

With this, the developer attempted to implement the same code but in the Edit Profile Form's `cleaned_data` method. However, the attempts were not fruitful, as the way the code was currently implemented required the image file to be saved to the database before any conversion was made, therefore skipping any conversion before saving to the database.

It is the developer's intention to encounter a useful solution to this issue, and the lighthouse performance error will surely be improved upon the next release.

# Significant Known Bugs

## Immutable QueryDict when accessing invitation messages

**Status**: Fixed

The project's Dashboard features a chat message window which allows users to send messages to one another about a particular invitation.

In order to get previously sent messages, an AJAX GET Handler was implemented, to return a queryset of existing messages for a current invitation as a `JSONResponse`, to be displayed in the chat window.

Consideirng that Django objects aren't `JSON Serializable`, the `Message` object needed to be prepared before being passed into the `JSONResponse`. The developer initially attempted this used Django's `model_to_dict()` function. However it became apparent that this method wasn't preserving the object's values, and was removing a non-editable field `date_of_message`.

Research was made into an alternative method, and the developer happened upon an [article post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21925671/convert-django-model-object-to-dict-with-all-of-the-fields-intact), which provided an answer to the problem.

The code used is thus (featured in [bookings/functions.py](bookings/functions.py)):

```
from itertools import chain


def to_dict(instance):
    """
    Alternative to python's 'model_to_dict' function, which
    was excluding the non-editable 'date_of_message' field.

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21925671/
    convert-django-model-object-to-dict-with-all-of-the-fields-intact
    """

    opts = instance._meta
    data = {}
    for f in chain(opts.concrete_fields, opts.private_fields):
        data[f.name] = f.value_from_object(instance)
    for f in opts.many_to_many:
        data[f.name] = [i.id for i in f.value_from_object(instance)]
    return data
```

This method of converting the object to a dictionary provided a solution, and all fields of the Message object were
then passed into the `JSONResponse` correctly.

## Filtering Dep List and Job List - All Query Parameters sent at once

**Status**: Fixed

The _Dep List_ and _Job List_ pages of the project feature filter and search functionality.

The initial goal of this functionality as to allow users to filter the query one criteria at a time, so the URL could be built as such:

- First Search

  - `/jobs/find_a_dep?instrument=Guitar`

- Second Search with another criteria added

  - `jobs/find_a_dep?instrument=Guitar&location=Manchester`

- Third Search with another criteria added
  - `jobs/find_a_dep?instrument=Guitar&location=Manchester&genre=Pop`

However, the initial implementation of this functionality resulted in all query parameters being included in the GET request. This resulted in the URL GET request looking something akin to this:

`/jobs/find_a_dep?instrument=Guitar&location=&genre=&available_today=`

Of course, this query would not return any results.

After some consideration and experimenting, a solution was found, involving some JavaScript code to disable the form elements immediately before submitting the form. The code flow is outline below:

- User clicks submit button.
- Define the form field's initial values in JavaScript.
- JavaScript code looks through the form field's values.
- If any initial default values are found to match the values defined, those form elements are disabled, and not added to the 'GET' request.
- Submit the form

This code elegantly solved the issue, and search criteria could then be added to the 'GET' request individually.

## Boto3 Audio Download - Signature Version

**Status**: Fixed

The project includes a feature for users to download audio files from a _Booking Detail_ page, which are added by the member who has sent them a booking.

In development, these files downloaded without issue, but upon deployment, it was discovered that a production backend needed to be configured in order to serve files as downloads from the Amazon S3 Bucket.

The developer [created a class](bookings/classes.py) to handle this functionality. However, upon manual testing, a 403 error was being thrown:

`The authorization mechanism you have provided is not supported. Please use AWS4-HMAC-SHA256.`

Upon research, it was found that the Signature Version which `boto3` originally used was outdated.

To remedy this, `boto3` needed to have it's Signature Version updated in order to be authenticated correctly:

```
from botocore.client import Config

def create_boto3_session(self):
        """
        Instantiate a boto3 client
        """
        client = boto3.client(
            "s3",
            config=Config(signature_version="s3v4"),
            region_name=self.region,
            aws_access_key_id=self.access_key,
            aws_secret_access_key=self.secret_key
        )

        return client

```

In the instance method of the class the developer created, the `boto3` object needed it's `config` variable updating, which was possible using `botocore.client`'s class `Config`.

Once this signature version was added, the tests passed, and audio files could be downloaded.
